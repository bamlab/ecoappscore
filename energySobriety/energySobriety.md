Data centers and networks are required to use apps on our smartphones. But did you know that they also have an impact on the environment ? Their emissions match almost 30% of the world carbon emissions due to the digital.

Therefore it is important to take into account this dimension while developing a mobile app : choosing the right set up for the host server or controlling the data volume exchanged can have a bigger impact that we expect.

We propose for now 2 key factors that we can easily measure to evaluate the impact of the usage of our phone :

- [consumed Data Volume](./consumedDataVolume/)
- [host Usage](./hostUsage/)

Each of this key factor contains smaller indicators that bring a more complete evaluation of the impact.

They are all described in details in this section with their grading scale, and their measures protocols.
