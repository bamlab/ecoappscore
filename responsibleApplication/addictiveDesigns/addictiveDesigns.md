# Addictive designs

## Problem

The so-called addictive designs designate and group together the design techniques of digital tools allowing to capture the user's attention as efficiently as possible and to keep it as long as possible.

## Measure

For this measure, we will count the number of designs that capture the user's attention as effectively as possible and then hold it as long as possible. The list of these tools can evolve with new technologies.

Addictive designs might encourage the visite of the application thanks to:

- Push Notifications
- Mail drip campaigns
- Sharing options

Addictive designs might trigger surprise effects thanks to:

- Automatic refresh of the news feed
- Autoplay
- Pull to refresh
- Interrupted scrolling
- User reactions (e.g. likes)

Addictive designs might extend the length of an UX action thanks to:

- Ads

Addictive designs might reward the user for its attendance thanks to:

- Gamification : reward for time & energy spent on the app or punishment (loss of functionality etc) for not visiting the app
- Scoring system

### Grading

- A : 0 or 1 addictive design
- B : 2 to 3 addictive designs
- C : 4 to 5 addictive designs
- D : more than 6 addictive designs

**Weighting in the total calculation** : 3
