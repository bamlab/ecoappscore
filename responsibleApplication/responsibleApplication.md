Developping mobile apps has an impact on the environment. But in our opinion, there is also a social dimension.

We create apps to answer the needs of our users - so our apps need to be useful, lovable and respectful to all of our users.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that over 15% of the world's population—or 1.3 billion people—self-identify as having a disability. Digital is now part of everyone's life. Therefore, making digital products accessible to the greater number of people is important. Some impairments are more impacted than others but still.

Developping app also bring the question of the usage that our users will have : there are now more and more techniques to keep the users on their phone such as it can have an impact on their life.

That's why we included this last pillar of responsibility.

We propose for now 2 key factors that we can easily measure to evaluate the impact of the usage of our phone :

- [accessibility](./accessibility/)
- [addictive designs](./addictiveDesigns/)

Each of this key factor contains for now only one indicator that brings a more complete evaluation of the impact.

They are all described in details in this section with their grading scale, and their measures protocols.
