Developing mobile apps has an impact on the environment and on society.

We create apps to answer the needs of our users - so our apps need to be useful, lovable and respectful to all of our users.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that over 15% of the world's population—or 1.3 billion people—self-identify as having a disability. Digital is now part of everyone's life. Therefore, making digital products accessible to the greater number of people is important.

Developing apps also raises the question of their usages. More and more techniques are developed to keep the users on their phone,using more battery and having an impact on their lives..

That's why we included this last pillar of responsibility.

We propose for now 2 key factors that we can easily measure to evaluate the impact of the usage of our phone :

- [accessibility](./accessibility/)
- [addictive designs](./addictiveDesigns/)

Each of this key factor contains for now only one indicator that brings a more complete evaluation of the impact.

They are all described in details in this section with their grading scale, and their measures protocols.
