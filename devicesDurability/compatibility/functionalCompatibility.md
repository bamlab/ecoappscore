# Functional Compatibility

## Problem

Some applications are not functional on all devices due to hardware limitations. New smartphones feature innovative technologies that didn't exist 5 or 10 years ago. If an app uses this kind of technologies, users with old devices could be affected and will not be able to benefits the full experience.

## Measure

For this measure, we will count how many features among those the app uses and how essential they are :

- NFC (Near field communication, as Apple Pay)

- Arkit (augmented reality)

- Touch ID

- Face ID

- Compass

### Grading

- A: No blocking features

- B: Some requirements for small bonuses

- C: Parts of the application are missing

- D: Unusable app

**Weight in the final calculation** : 3
