# Launching duration

## Problem

The longer the boot time, the more it is representative of an intense CPU load. This can impact the processor degradation (as well as the power consumption). The more important the boot time is, the more the user can be incited to change his phone because he doesn't find it performing well.

## Measure

Using a script, we launch the app's .apk file on a given phone and measure how much time it takes to see a graphic element.

### Grading

At BAM, performance measurements at startup are calibrated on the Wiko fever.

- A : The app starts in less than 3 seconds
- B : The app takes between 3 and 6 seconds to start
- C : The app takes between 6 and 10 seconds to start
- D : The app takes more than 10 seconds to start

**Weighting in the total calculation** : 3
