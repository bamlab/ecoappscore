# Documents and data

## Problem

Even more than the size of the app, the documents and data stored/cached by the app on the user's phone fill up their memory without them having good control over it. When the memory is saturated, the user will try to switch devices.

## Measure

For this measure, we will use Android only. iOS data is not relevant as it doesn't show all the data stored for an app (for example Whatsapp's photos are hidden behind "Other" data)

### Android

Use a Samsung J3.

Hold application icon > Info button > Storage > Delete Data and Clear Cache

Use the app for 10 minutes straight and try to use as many features as possible. Then you can go back to your app's information and add up the sum of both generated data and cache.

### Grading

Follow the scale below:

- A < 10 Mb : Small app that does not use cache
- B < 30 Mb : App that does not use a lot of cache
- C < 100 Mb : App that uses the cache but with light data
- D > 100 Mb : App that uses the cache with large data

**Weighting in the total calculation** : 3

## Other information

This indicator shows that you must care about what you store in cache! Try to clean as much useless info as possible.
