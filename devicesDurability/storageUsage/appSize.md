# App's size

## Problem

Phone storage is limited. Nowadays it's becoming a real issue for phone owners that cannot have all their favourite app on their phone and sometimes need to chose between deleting some of them or changing phone. Also the issue was solved previously with the addition of the micro SD card. But with the improvements of the latest years, fewer and fewer phones possess a micro SD port.

## Measure

For this measure, we will use both an android and an iOS devices.

### iOS

Try to use a device that "renders at 2x" such as an iPhone SE. You can see the guide [here](https://www.paintcodeapp.com/news/ultimate-guide-to-iphone-resolutions)

Then go to Parameters > General > Stockage > Choose your app > Size

### Android

Use a Samsung J3.

Hold application icon > Info button > Storage > App's size

### Grading

Compute the average between iOS and Android size, then then following the scale below you can set the grade of this indicator.

- A < 50 Mb : Small and optimized app
- B < 100 Mb : Large but optimized app, or small and not so optimized app
- C < 150 Mb : Very large app or large and not optimized app
- D > 150 Mb : Too large app, insult to optimization

## Other information

The download limit for an app without a wifi connexion used to be 150Mb, it was recently raised to 200Mb
