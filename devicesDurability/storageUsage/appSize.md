# App's size

## Problem

Phone storage is limited: try to make the app as small as possible so as not to encourage users to change their phone for one with more memory. Also nowadays, fewer and fewer phones have a micro sd port.

## Measure

For this measure, we will use both an android and an iOS device.

### iOS

Try to use a device that "renders at 2x" such as an iPhone SE. You can see the guide [here](https://www.paintcodeapp.com/news/ultimate-guide-to-iphone-resolutions)

Then go to Parameters > General > Stockage > Choose your app > Size

### Android

Use a Samsung J3.

Hold application icon > Info button > Storage > App's size

### Grading

Compute the average between iOS and Android size, then gave the grade :

- A < 50 Mb : Small and optimized app
- B < 100 Mb : Large but optimized app, or small and not so optimized app
- C < 150 Mb : Very large app or large and not optimized app
- D > 150 Mb : Too large app, insult to optimization

## Other informations

The download limit for an app without a wifi connexion used to be 150Mb, it was recently raised to 200Mb
