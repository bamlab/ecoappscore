Did you know that 80% of the carbon footprint of a mobile is due to his production and only 20% to his usage ? That’s why making our apps more respectful of the devices and more compatible is needed. We definitely do not want our apps to have a negative impact on the battery, or the storage of the phone that could urge the users to change their phone and buy a new one.

We’ve identified 4 key factors in our apps that could have an impact and urge the users to change their phone :

- [battery consumption](./batteryConsumption/)
- [storage usage](./storageUsage/)
- [compatibility](./compatibility/)
- [performances](./performances/)

Each of this key factor contains smaller indicators that bring a more complete evaluation of the impact.

They are all described in details in this section with their grading scale, and their measures protocols.
