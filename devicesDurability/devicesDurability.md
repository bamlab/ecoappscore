Did you know that 80% of the carbon footprint of a mobile is due to his production and only 20% is attributed to his usage ? That’s why making our apps more respectful of the devices and more compatible is needed. It is essential to avoid negative impacts on battery life and storage capacity, as they can lead users to prematurely replace their phones, resulting in unnecessary resource consumption and environmental impact.

We’ve identified 4 key factors in our apps that could have an impact and urge the users to change their phone :

- [battery consumption](./batteryConsumption/)
- [storage usage](./storageUsage/)
- [compatibility](./compatibility/)
- [performances](./performances/)

Each of this key factor contains smaller indicators that bring a more complete evaluation of the impact.

They are all described in details in this section with their grading scale, and their measures protocols.
