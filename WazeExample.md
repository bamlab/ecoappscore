# An example of measurement : Waze

Let's take Waze, a driver assistance app, as an example to compute a score.

Waze obtains the final grade of ðŸ”´ **8.75 / 20** . 

Here is the detail of each indicator parts in the final grade:

## Device durability

### Battery consumption

- For the [**bluetooth usage**][1] indicator, looking at playstore permissions, Waze could be paired with Bluetooth Devices, without needing it on a constant basis according to its users. It gives it the rating of C

- For the [**colours usage**][2] indicator, the app has a dark mode, the grade is then A

- For the [**GPS usage**][3] indicator, Waze needs to use the user location everywhere to work, its grade for this indicator is D

### Compatibility

- For the [**functionnal compatibility**][4] indicator, Waze could use a compass for some functionnalities, according to this, its grade is B

- For the [**os compatibility**][5] indicator, following the table and looking for the information on PlayStore and AppStore, we see a compatibility of 98% for android users and 94% for iOS users, the weighted average is above 95%, grading it at A

- For the [**screen compatibility**][6] indicator, Waze is optimized on all type of screens, grading it at A also

### Performances

- For the **Flashlight score** indicator, we did the measurement with Flashlight cloud and found a score of 60, which gives the app a score of D.

### Storage usage

- For the [**app size**][9] indicator, a freshly installed app weight 175Mb that is over 150Mb, the grade is then D

- For the [**documents and data indicator**][10], after using the app for 10 minutes, the amount of data stored in our J3 is 83Mb, the according grade is C (between 30 and 100Mb)

## Energy Sobriety

### Consumed data volume

- For the [**network data**][11] indicator, we measure 66,26Mb of consumed Data in 10 minutes, which gives the grade C (between 50 and 100b)

### Host usage

- For the [**environments number**][12] and [**host localisation**](energySobriety/hostUsage/hostLocalisation.md) indicator, we couldn't find the information concerning Waze, we then skip those indicators

## Responsible Application

### Accessibility

- For the [**accessibility**][13] indicator, we had tested the buttons and images with voiceover and some are not well described, according to our indicator, this gives the grade D

### Addictive designs

- For the [**addictive designs**][14] indicator, we found those 5 categories in the app: Push Notifications, sharing options, advertisement, gamification (success or functionnality loss depending on the usage), and score system. This leads to the grade of C.

## Final Score

Once we have obtained the grades for each indicator, we convert them into numbers with the following equivalences.

- A = 3
- B = 2
- C = 1
- D = 0

Then, we add the weight of each indicator. In the order given above :

```
(3x3 + 3x1 + 0x3 + 2x3 + 3x3 + 3x2 + 0x3 + 0x2 + 1x3 + 1x3 + --- + --- + 0x1 + 1x3) / (3x3+3x3+3x3+3x3+3x2+3x3+3x3+3x2+3x3+3x3+3x1+3x3) = 42 / 96 = 0,45
```

Usually we score out of 20, which gives the final grade of **8.75/20**
